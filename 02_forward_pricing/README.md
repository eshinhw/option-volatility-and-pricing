# Forward Pricing

- forward price = current cash price + costs of buying now - benefits of buying now
- Traders in forward or futures contracts sometimes refer to the **basis**, the difference between the cash price and the forward price. In most cases, the basis will be a negative number - the costs of buying now will outweight the benefits of buying now.
- A normal or **contago** commodity market is one in which long-term futures contracts trade at a premium to short-term contracts.
- If the cash price of a commodity is greater than a futures price, the market is **backward** or in **backwardation**.
- The benefit of being able to obtain a commodity right now is sometimes referred to as a **convenience yield**.
