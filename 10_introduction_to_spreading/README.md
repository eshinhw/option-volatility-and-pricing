# 10. Introduction to Spreading

There are many different approaches to trading.
- Scalping by trying to determine an equilibrium price that reflected a balance between buyers and sellers.
- Speculating on the direction in which the underlying contract will move. The directional position can be taken in a variety of ways in the cash market, in the futures market, or in the option market. **If a trader's sole consideration is direction, he is usually better advised to take the position in the underlying market. If he does and he is right, he is assured of making a profit.**
- **Most successful option traders are spread traders.** Because option evaluation is based on the laws of probability and the laws of probability can be expected to even out only over long periods of time, option traders must often hold positions for extended periods. **Spreading enbales an option trader to take advantage of theoretically mispriced options while at the same time reducing the effects of short-term "bad luck".**

## What is a Spread?

- A spread is a strategy that involves taking opposing positions in different but related instruments.
- A profitable spreading strategy is predicated on the assumption that the values of the positions will change at different rates.
