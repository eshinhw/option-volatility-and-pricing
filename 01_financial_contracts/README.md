# 1. Financial Contracts

- The trading of stock on an exchange is usually considered to be a spot or cash transation: the buyer and seller agree on the price, the buyer pays the seller, and the seller delivers the stock.
- When a forward contract is traded on an organized exchange, it is usually referred to as a **futures contract**. The exchange guarantees the integrity of the contract.

## Buying and Selling

- The amount of **open interest** is the number of contracts traded on an exchange that have not yet been closed out which is a widely used measure of trading activity in exchange-traded derivative contracts. Logically, the number of long and short contracts that have not been closed out must be equal because for every buyer there must be a seller.
- When the total trade results in a debit, it is a long position. When it results in a credit, it is a short position.

## Notional Value of a Forward Contract

- For physical commodities, the notional value of a forward contract is equal to the number of units to be delivered at maturity multiplied by the unit price.
- For financial futures, where the contract is not settled through physical delivery, the notional value is equal to the cash price of the index or instrument multiplied by a point value.
- The point value of a stock index or similiar contract is set by the exhcnage so that the contract has a notional value that is deemed reasonable for trading.

## Settlement Procedures

- Variation is a credit or debit that results from fluctuations in the price of a futures contract. A variation payment can either earn interest, if the variation results in a credit, or lose interest, if the variation results in a debit.
